## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and fully functional web page for a headphones website. You will be implementing the web page from scratch without relying on any external libraries. This means that you have the freedom to implement it in your own unique way while using the HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design techniques you have learned.

## Designer File

To provide you with a clear visual reference, we have prepared a designer file that demonstrates how the web page should look. You can access the designer file using the following link:

[Headphones Website Designer File](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/lQyysE5EtgvfGL__RNW9eg)

Please refer to the designer file for guidance on layout, color schemes, typography, and other visual elements.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development of the headphones website, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

3. Use your HTML, CSS, and web development skills to implement the web page according to the designer file.

4. Continuously test your changes in a browser to ensure that the web page appears as intended and is fully functional.

5. Once you are satisfied with your implementation, you can deploy the web page to a hosting service of your choice or share the files with others.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
headphones/
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
  â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
  â”œâ”€â”€ images/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ headphone1.jpg
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ headphone2.jpg
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â”œâ”€â”€ js/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- The `index.html` file is the entry point for your web page and should contain the HTML structure of the page.
- The `styles.css` file is where you will define the styles and layout of the web page.
- The `images/` directory is where you should store any images or graphics used on the web page.
- The `js/` directory is for any JavaScript files you may want to include (optional).
- The `README.md` file contains important information and instructions for the project.

Feel free to modify the project structure to suit your implementation approach, but ensure that the required files are present and organized appropriately.
